    "### What Is Thread\n",
    "\n",
    "The Thread class represents a thread of execution in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways to use a Thread; they are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Execute a target function.\n",
    "2. Extend the class and override run()\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Execute a Target Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The Thread class can execute a target function in another thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be achieved by creating an instance of the Thread class and specifying the target function to execute via the target keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "The thread can then be started by calling the start() function and it will execute the target function in another thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# a target function that does something\n",
    "def work()\n",
    "\t# do something...\n",
    " \n",
    "# create a thread to execute the work() function\n",
    "thread = Thread(target=work)\n",
    "# start the thread\n",
    "thread.start()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the target function takes arguments, they can be specified via the args argument that takes a tuple or the kwargs argument that takes a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "...\n",
    "# create a thread to execute the work() function\n",
    "thread = Thread(target=work, args=(123,))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The target task function is useful for executing one-off ad hoc tasks that probably donâ€™t interact with external state other than passed-in arguments and do not return a value\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extend the Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The Thread class can be extended for tasks that may involve multiple functions and maintain state.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be achieved by extending the Thread object and overriding the run() function. The overridden run() function is then executed when the start() function of the thread is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# define a custom thread\n",
    "class CustomThread(Thread):\n",
    "\t# custom run function\n",
    "\tdef run():\n",
    "\t\t# do something...\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "# create the custom thread\n",
    "thread = CustomThread()\n",
    "# start the thread\n",
    "thread.start()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Overriding the Thread class offers more flexibility than calling a target function. It allows the object to have multiple functions and to have object member variables for storing state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extending the Thread class is suited for longer-lived tasks and perhaps services within an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "* Thread - a flow of execution. Due to GIL (GLobal Interpreter Lock), each thread takes turn to run to achieve concurrency\n",
    "* CPU bound - Program/tasks spends most of it's time waiting for internal events (CPU interrupt etc) - ise multiprocessing\n",
    "* I/O bound - Use multithreading. Each task/program waiting for external event like I/O"

    "## Thread Pool\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Is ThreadPoolExecutor\n",
    "\n",
    "The ThreadPoolExecutor class provides a thread pool in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "A thread is a thread of execution. Each thread belongs to a process and can share memory (state and data) with other threads in the same process. In Python, like many modern programming languages, threads are created and managed by the underlying operating system, so-called system-threads or native threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a thread pool by instantiating the class and specifying the number of threads via the max_workers argument; for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "...\n",
    "# create a thread pool\n",
    "executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then submit tasks to be executed by the thread pool using the map() and the submit() functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The map() function matches the built-in map() function and takes a function name and an iterable of items. The target function will then be called for each item in the iterable as a separate task in the process pool. An iterable of results will be returned if the target function returns a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The call to map() does not block, but each result yielded in the returned iterator will block until the associated task is completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "...\n",
    "# call a function on each item in a list and process results\n",
    "for result in executor.map(task, items):\n",
    "\t# process result...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also issue tasks to the pool via the submit() function that takes the target function name and any arguments and returns a Future object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Future object can be used to query the status of the task (e.g. done(), running(), or cancelled()) and can be used to get the result or exception raised by the task once completed. The calls to result() and exception() will block until the task associated with the Future is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "...\n",
    "# submit a task to the pool and get a future immediately\n",
    "future = executor.submit(task, item)\n",
    "# get the result once the task is done\n",
    "result = future.result()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are finished with the thread pool, it can be shut down by calling the shutdown() function in order to release all of the worker threads and their resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "...\n",
    "# shutdown the thread pool\n",
    "executor.shutdown()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of creating and shutting down the thread pool can be simplified by using the context manager that will automatically call the shutdown() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "...\n",
    "# create a thread pool\n",
    "with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:\n",
    "\t# call a function on each item in a list and process results\n",
    "\tfor result in executor.map(task, items):\n",
    "\t\t# process result...\n",
    "\t# ...\n",
    "# shutdown is called automatically\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Similarities Between ThreadPoolExecutor and Thread\n",
    "\n",
    "The ThreadPoolExecutor and Thread classes are very similar. Letâ€™s review some of the most important similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Both Use Thread\n",
    "\n",
    "    Both the ThreadPoolExecutor and Thread are based on Python threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python supports real system-level or native threads, as opposed to virtual or green threads. This means that Python threads are created using services provided by the underlying operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Thread class is a representation of system threads supported by Python. The ThreadPoolExecutor makes use of Python Threads internally and is a high-level of abstraction.\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Both Can Run Ad Hoc Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "    Both the ThreadPoolExecutor class and the Thread can be used to execute ad hoc tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The ThreadPoolExecutor can execute ad hoc tasks via the submit() or map() function. Whereas the Thread class can execute ad hoc tasks via the target argument.\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Both Are Subject to the GIL\n",
    "\n",
    "    Both the ThreadPoolExecutor class and the Thread are subject to the global interpreter lock (GIL).\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences Between ThreadPoolExecutor and Thread\n",
    "\n",
    "The ThreadPoolExecutor and Thread are also quite different. Letâ€™s review some of the most important differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Heterogeneous vs. Homogeneous Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "    The ThreadPoolExecutor is for heterogeneous tasks, whereas Thread is for homogeneous tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The ThreadPoolExecutor is designed to execute heterogeneous tasks, that is tasks that do not resemble each other. For example, each task submitted to the thread pool may be a different target function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Thread class is designed to execute homogeneous tasks. For example, if the Thread class is extended, then it only supports a single task type defined by the custom class.\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Reuse vs. Single Use\n",
    "    The ThreadPoolExecutor supports reuse, whereas the Thread class is for single use.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The ThreadPoolExecutor class is designed to submit many ad hoc tasks at ad hoc times throughout the life of a program. The threads in the pool remain active and ready to execute work until the pool is shutdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Thread class is designed for a single use. This is the case regardless of using the target argument or extending the class. Once the Thread has executed the task, the object cannot be reused and a new instance must be created.\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Multiple Tasks vs. Single Task\n",
    "    The ThreadPoolExecutor supports multiple tasks, whereas the Thread class supports a single task.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The ThreadPoolExecutor is designed to submit and execute multiple tasks. For example, the map() function is explicitly designed to perform multiple function calls concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Additionally, the concurrent.futures module provides functions such as wait() and as_completed() specifically designed for managing multiple concurrent tasks in the thread pool via their associated Future objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Thread class is designed for executing a single task, either via the target argument or by extending the class. There are no built-in tools for managing multiple concurrent tasks; instead, such tools would have to be developed on a case-by-case basis.\n",
